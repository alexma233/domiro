Domiro streamlines domain qualification by uniting DNS pre-checks and RDAP verification in a single, reliable workspace. Bulk import, smart deduplication, and export tooling help acquisition teams validate portfolios before committing budgets. The app is built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Material UI (MD3)** for responsive, cross-platform operations.

## Features

- Bulk input via manual entry, CSV/TXT uploads, or pattern dictionaries with automatic cleanup
- Verify delegation status with multi-provider DNS over HTTPS and highlight RDAP candidates
- Run RDAP lookups with rate-limit awareness and export structured results for downstream tools

## Development Environment

- Node.js v22
- Package manager: npm

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
